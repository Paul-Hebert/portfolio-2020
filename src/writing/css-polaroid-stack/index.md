Recently my girlfriend and I took our puppy to the coast for the first time. I thought it would be fun to commemorate our trip by creating a unique web page displaying our pictures as a stack of polaroids. Here's the finished product:

{% partial 'figure', '{"iframeSrc": "/experiments/polaroid-stack/"}' %}

This was a lot of fun to put together and I'm pretty pleased with the finished product.
