  <h1>Redesigning my Website</h1>

  <p>
      As a web designer and developer, my portfolio is the best representation of my
      skills and talents.
  </p>

  </div>

More than my resume, [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Paul-Hebert),
or [work bio](https://cloudfour.com/is/paul/), my portfolio represents me as a
designer, developer, and human being. Because of this, it's important for me to
feel that my portfolio is designed and developed with the same thought and care
that I put into my work with [Cloud Four](https://cloudfour.com/).

Because of this I've redesigned my portfolio a few times over the years. The
latest iteration was from 2016 (about 4 years old at the time of this writing).
Reviewing the site now, there are a handful of areas where there are clear
opportunities for improvement.

## Injecting More Personality

When I built the current version of my portfolio I was getting ready to graduate
college, freelancing, and looking for a professional gig. I was doing everything
I could to look more like "professional" and looking back at my portfolio now
it shows. There's a lot I still like about my portfolio but I'm not sure how
well it represents _me_ as a person.

I'd like to inject more personality into the site through illustration,
typography, animation, and interaction.

## Adding Another Layer of Polish

I've learned a lot about design since I built my previous site. In addition to
injecting more of my personality into the site, I hope that this redesign can
take the site to the next level in terms of design: from good to great!

## Adding a Blog

At [Cloud Four](https://cloudfour.com/) I've had the opportunity to start
blogging professionally and I've found that I really enjoyed it. With my old
site I had published a [couple](link to web colors) [articles](link to logo post)
but they were always 1-offs, and there wasn't a good structure for regular
writing.

One of my priorities in redesigning my site was to add a place where I could
easily write and share my thoughts. I wanted these blog posts to shine with pure
text content but also allow custom visualizations and interactions to complement
my writing.

## Highlighting Open Source Contributions

At [Cloud Four](https://cloudfour.com/) I've also had the opportunity to
contribute to a variety of open source projects. It's important to me to give
back to the open source community that has helped me to learn and grow, and I'd
like to highlight how I've been able to contribute over the years.

## Adding a Place for Art

When I was a teen I wanted to be a professional artist. This is what got me into
design which snowballed into an interest in web development. I still enjoy
making art, though I don't have as much time for it as I once did. I wanted a
place to showcase this art and hoped that it would encourage me to draw more!

## Moving to a New Tech Stack

I could technically achieve the goals described above without a full redesign of
my current site. However, over the last 4 years the tools I enjoy using and feel
comfortable with have changed a lot.

At the time I was writing a lot of PHP back-ends, while these days I write
almost exclusively Node apps. The last few years have also seen a huge rise in
quality tooling for building static sites. I wanted to move to static site
generation with Node, and hoped that switching to a tech stack I preferred would
make it more likely that I would make regular updates instead of letting my
portfolio stagnate for years at a time.

## The Next Steps

As I work through the process of redesigning and rebuilding my portfolio I'll be
writing blog posts to document the process.

Hopefully these will be links soon ;)
