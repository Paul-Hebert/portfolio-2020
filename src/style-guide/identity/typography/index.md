# Typography

This site uses Libre Baskerville for headings, block quotes, and other display text. Roboto is used for body copy. For code, it falls back to a stack using commonly installed monospace fonts.

For more in-depth typographic experience you can review [the prose component](/style-guide/components/prose/) or [recent blog posts](/writing/).
