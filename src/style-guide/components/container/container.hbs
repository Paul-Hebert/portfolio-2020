title: Containers
notes: |
  Containers are a layout component. They are used to build major page blocks.
  They apply a maximum width to content as well as some base padding.

  There is an `--inner` modifier to make a container receive extra horizontal
  padding.

<div class="container">
  This is a full width container.
</div>

<div class="container container--inner">
  This is a <code>container--inner</code>.
</div>
